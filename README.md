## Sending Data from C# to LightningChart<sup>&#174; </sup> JS

In order to send data to LightningChart<sup>&#174; </sup> JS , using MVC framework the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction which retrieves data from model for line series(2D chart) and 3D chart. Using ViewData , data will be transfers from Controller to View.
For chart 2D
```
 string data_array = "[{'x':1, 'y':20},{'x':2,'y':33},{'x':3, 'y':42},{'x':4,'y':52}]";
            // Transfer data from controller to View.
            ViewData["DataPoints"] = data_array;
            return View();
```

For chart 3D
``` 
 // setting number of series and points to be generated in each series.
            var point = GeneratePointSeries(6, 10);
           
 // Transfer data from controller to View.
            ViewData["DataPoints"] = point;
            return View();
```
